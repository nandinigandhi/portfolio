                    9pm is a short film that is begins by contexualising why it is being created and then turns into a contemplation of the word 'witness' and what it means to be a witness in its truest, purest form. I learned a lot of new skills while developing this film and it is my most honest, most vulnerable, most 'me' work I have ever allowed myself to create.<br><br>

                    I used the following tools and software to develop this body of work: <br>
                    — Adobe Premier Pro <br>
                    — Adobe After Effects <br>
                    — GarageBand <br>
                    — A Canon camera + my iPhone <br>
                    — Singing, humming, strumming, piano-ing <br>
                    — Writing + Research (spiritual, objective, cultural)
                
                </p>

                    This project is still being worked upon but here is a sneak-peak of what's going on!

                </p>

                <p>
                    
                    —I like to think of 9pm in terms of two acts; act 1 consists of the context and act 2 is a contemplation on what is it to be a witness, what it is to be human. Every single element, whether it is the sound, the words, the imagery, the concept was spurced directly from my brain. I wanted the film to feel as though it was an extension of the mind of the viewer. I focused a lot on the audio quality and general environemnt it created immensely because the whole thing is essentiallt voices in the head- the spoken and the sung. <br><br>

                    It was very important for me to create subtitles with a lot of intentionality because I wnated to create this sense of the viewer also reading along as I spoke so their own voice would be one of the voices they were hearing as they experienced the film to craft a unique experience for everyone who watched. The imagery was a foil for all of these voices and was extremely simple, unedited, and unromanticised. it simply is what it is, which is the point the film sets out to make. <br><br>

                    There is so much to say about this film but i will end with this: everyone is human and I have seen viewers have extremely emotional reactions because every single person relates to what it is to be human, what it is to have memories and experiences that have shaped who they are.
